# Collatz-Conjecture in Java

This is a simple algorithm that, given an integer greater than zero, calculates and shows all the steps up to the number 1

# Collatz-Conjecture

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows:

  Start with any positive integer n. 
  Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
    if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. 
    If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1
    
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
